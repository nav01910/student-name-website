    Hello, my name is Navjeet.
    my life is a joke. the despair of existing overburdens me.
    If we become friends, the doors of dissonance will haunt u forever.
    Also I study in University of Delhi and i have a beautiful cat.

    The skills i have acquired up until now are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODEJS, REACT.
    Created some CLI apps which will be showcased here.
